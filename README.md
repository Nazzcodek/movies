This repository contains the solutions to the problems from the [project]('Project Questions.pdf'). The data for the analysis was obtained from the [link](https://t.co/Mcrr94P4Ey).

ETL
I performed a simple ETL (extract, transform, and load) on the data using Python with the code in the main.py file. The ETL process is as follows:

- Extract the data from the CSV file.
- Transform the data by cleaning it and removing any errors.
- Load the data into a PostgreSQL database.

The ETL code is in `main.py`

the analysis followed predetermined question in the `project questions.pdf` file, and below are the images to the queries.
